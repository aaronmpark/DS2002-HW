As we worked on other database filetypes with SQL, utilizing these commands through python has felt a lot easier than using SQL. Maybe this is because I am more familiar with Python. It is very interesting to see how something as advanced as reading a CSV file can be done in one line of code, as well as things like filtering and manipulating the data. These skills will be applied to my future data analysis projects by helping me clean up data and also analyze data.
	The most challenging aspect of this assignment was understanding what some of the functions would do. In particular, I had to learn about some of the functions in the matplotlib library and seaborn library. These helped me create the bar plot and scatter plot for the extra credit portion of the assignment. However, I was able to overcome this by looking through the documentation on what the functions did within the code.
	The insights gained from analyzing ACC basketball statistics can be applied to other real-world datasets from different fields of work. The evaluation of a player's rebounds or assists can be compared to the evaluation of an employee's performance overall. This kind of comparison can be seen in other fields. For example, in a business aspect, we can measure the performance of a certain product. This experience will prepare me for future data science challenges by allowing me to fully understand how to read, filter, and visualize data within any field of work. Data manipulation can be done in any field of work, so this skill will allow me to develop further in this field.
